### ❌ WHAT NOT TO SAY (Avoid These)

#### Numbers to Avoid
```
❌ "188 users" (sounds small out of context)
❌ "Only X users" (minimizes achievement)
❌ "Beta with limited users" (sounds unfinished)
❌ "2,578 analyses" (outdated, use 60K+)
```

#### Specific User References
```
❌ "Alessio De Marco analyzed 1,225 photos" (privacy concern)
❌ "Ian Greenwood, our top user" (no explicit permission)
❌ Any specific user names without written consent
❌ Specific company names without permission
```

#### Potentially Negative Framing
```
❌ "Still in beta" (emphasize stability instead)
❌ "Small but growing community" (focus on professional quality)
❌ "Limited availability" (unless creating scarcity intentionally)
❌ "Early stage product" (emphasize maturity and reliability)
```
