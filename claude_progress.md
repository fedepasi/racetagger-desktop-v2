# RaceTagger Development Progress

## Latest Session: 2025-10-20

### Release v1.0.10 - Production Build Completed ✅

**Objective:** Prepare and build version 1.0.10 for production release with Apple notarization.

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Verified version 1.0.10 in package.json
2. ✅ Fixed code signing issues with Windows DLL files by adding "vendor/win32" to signIgnore
3. ✅ Built ARM64 macOS application with electron-builder
4. ✅ Successfully signed app with Developer ID certificate (FEDERICO PASINETTI MNP388VJLQ)
5. ✅ Completed Apple notarization for ARM64 build
6. ✅ Created distribution files:
   - RaceTagger-1.0.10-arm64.dmg (500 MB)
   - RaceTagger-1.0.10-arm64-mac.zip (492 MB)

**Build Details:**
- Platform: macOS (darwin)
- Architecture: ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Electron version: 36.9.4
- Code signing identity: 6372C9C9F29C62447F165F9439888931C50EBA16
- Notarization: Successful
- Native modules: better-sqlite3, raw-preview-extractor, Sharp.js

**Files Ready for Distribution:**
- `release/RaceTagger-1.0.10-arm64.dmg` - DMG installer (notarized)
- `release/RaceTagger-1.0.10-arm64-mac.zip` - ZIP archive (notarized)
- `release/mac-arm64/RaceTagger.app` - Signed and notarized app bundle

**Known Issues:**
- x64 build fails with entitlements error (not needed, ARM64 only required)
- When building both architectures, x64 failure can interrupt DMG creation
- Solution: Build only ARM64 with `--mac --arm64` flag

**Next Steps:**
- Create git tag v1.0.10
- Create GitHub release with DMG and ZIP files
- Update release notes
- Publish to distribution channels
