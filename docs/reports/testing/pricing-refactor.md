# Pricing Modal Refactor - Testing Guide

## Overview
The desktop app pricing modal has been refactored to eliminate hardcoded prices and redirect users to the web pricing page. This ensures consistency and maintains a single source of truth (database-driven pricing).

## What Changed

### Before
- Modal showed 3 hardcoded pricing packages:
  - STARTER: ‚Ç¨29 ‚Üí 3,000 analyses
  - PROFESSIONAL: ‚Ç¨49 ‚Üí 10,000 analyses
  - STUDIO: ‚Ç¨99 ‚Üí 25,000 analyses
- Prices were inconsistent with web app
- Required rebuild to update pricing

### After
- Modal shows:
  - **Early Bird Hero**: "Special Launch Offer - Up to 42% OFF"
  - **Benefits Grid**: 4 key benefits (Tokens Never Expire, No Monthly Fees, etc.)
  - **CTA Button**: "View Pricing & Buy Tokens ‚Üí" redirects to web
  - **Urgency Banner**: Limited to first 81 founders ‚Ä¢ Until December 31, 2025

    - Try to open pricing page

### ‚úÖ Console/Log Testing

15. **Check Console for Errors**
    - Open DevTools (if in dev mode)
    - Click through all interactions

16. **Verify API Calls**

      [Enhanced Processor] Pricing page opened successfully
      ```

## Known Limitations

- **Requires Internet**: Button opens external web page (requires connection)
- **No Offline Fallback**: If web is down, users can't see pricing (acceptable trade-off for consistency)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert commit:
```bash
git revert bedd9df
npm run compile
npm start
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All checklist items pass
‚úÖ No JavaScript console errors
‚úÖ Browser opens to correct URL
‚úÖ Modal design matches mockup
‚úÖ Responsive design works on mobile
‚úÖ Purchase flow completes successfully

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Test on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux)
2. Test with production web URL
3. Verify analytics tracking (if implemented)
4. Update user documentation
5. Deploy to beta testers
