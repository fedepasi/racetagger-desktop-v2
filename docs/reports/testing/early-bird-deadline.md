# Early Bird Deadline Auto-Hide Testing Guide

## Overview
The pricing modal now automatically detects when the Early Bird period has ended (December 31, 2025) and updates the UI accordingly.

## Automatic Changes After Deadline

### Before Deadline (Until Dec 31, 2025)
```
Hero Title: "Special Launch Offer"
Hero Subtitle: "Up to 42% OFF for the first 81 founders"
Urgency Banner: ‚è∞ "Limited Until December 31, 2025" (VISIBLE)
```

### After Deadline (From Jan 1, 2026)
```
Hero Title: "Get More Analyses"
Hero Subtitle: "Flexible Token Packs - Choose what fits your needs"
Urgency Banner: (HIDDEN)
```

## How to Test

### Option 1: Wait Until January 1, 2026 üòÖ
Just kidding! Use one of the methods below.

### Option 2: Modify Deadline in Code (Recommended)

1. **Open the file**: `renderer/js/enhanced-processing.js`

2. **Find line 108**:
   ```javascript
   const earlyBirdDeadline = new Date('2025-12-31T23:59:59Z');
   ```

3. **Change to a past date** (for testing):
   ```javascript
   const earlyBirdDeadline = new Date('2024-01-01T23:59:59Z');
   ```

4. **Save and restart app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open pricing modal** ‚Üí Should show "Get More Analyses" (no Early Bird)

6. **Restore original date** when done testing

### Option 3: Change System Clock (Not Recommended)

1. Change your system date to January 1, 2026
2. Open the app
3. Open pricing modal
4. **IMPORTANT**: Restore your system date after testing!

### Option 4: Use Browser DevTools Console

If running in dev mode with DevTools:

1. Open pricing modal
2. Open DevTools Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Type:
   ```javascript
   // Simulate deadline passed
   const heroTitle = document.querySelector('#token-info-modal .pricing-hero h3');
   const heroSubtitle = document.querySelector('#token-info-modal .hero-subtitle');
   const urgencyBanner = document.querySelector('#token-info-modal .urgency-banner');

   heroTitle.textContent = 'Get More Analyses';
   heroSubtitle.innerHTML = '<strong>Flexible Token Packs</strong> - Choose what fits your needs';
   urgencyBanner.style.display = 'none';
   ```

## Troubleshooting

2. Verify timezone handling (deadline is in UTC)
3. Clear browser cache if running in dev
4. Check console for JavaScript errors

### Text Doesn't Update
1. Verify selectors match HTML structure
2. Check if modal HTML was modified
3. Look for CSS `!important` overrides

## Sync with Web App

The deadline date matches the web app configuration:

- **Desktop App**: `renderer/js/enhanced-processing.js` ‚Üí line 108

**IMPORTANT**: If you change the deadline in the web app, also update the desktop app!

## Production Behavior

In production:
- ‚úÖ No rebuild needed when deadline passes
- ‚úÖ Automatic transition on January 1, 2026
- ‚úÖ All users see updated messaging automatically
- ‚úÖ No server calls required (pure client-side check)

## Rollback

If issues arise after deadline:
```bash
git revert 28a5056
npm run compile
npm start
```
