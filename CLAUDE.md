3. Images processed through unified processor or streaming pipeline
4. RAW files converted using dcraw with automatic format detection
5. AI analysis performed using parallel analyzer with rate limiting
6. Race numbers matched against CSV data with fuzzy matching
7. Metadata written using XMP sidecars or direct EXIF embedding
8. Results stored in both Supabase (online) and SQLite (local cache)
9. Enhanced results displayed with modern UI components

### Build Configuration
- TypeScript compilation from `src/` to `dist/`
- Electron-builder configuration for cross-platform builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Native module rebuilding required for better-sqlite3, Sharp.js, and dcraw
- Asset packaging with proper native module handling

## Important Development Notes

- **Native modules** (better-sqlite3, Sharp.js) require rebuilding after npm install
- **dcraw dependency** automatically installed and managed during setup
- **Database schema** initialization happens after app.ready() event
- **Session restoration** handles both online/offline scenarios gracefully
- **Memory management** is critical due to large image processing workloads
- **Performance testing** should be run regularly, especially after architectural changes
- **RAW processing** uses dcraw as primary converter with Sharp.js fallback
- **Streaming pipeline** automatically activates for large batch processing to prevent memory issues

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

1. **Use streaming pipeline** for batches > 50 images or when memory usage > 70%
2. **Monitor disk space** during processing and enable cleanup when < 5GB free
3. **Optimize parallelization** based on CPU cores and memory availability
4. **Cache converted RAW files** when processing similar batches
5. **Profile memory usage** regularly and adjust buffer pool sizes as needed

### Debugging and Development

- Use performance dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Enable debug logging for specific components via environment variables
- Use test-dcraw interface to verify RAW processing functionality
- Monitor token usage and API rate limiting in enhanced processing UI
- Check session manager for workflow recovery after crashes

#### Analysis Logging System

The desktop app features a comprehensive analysis logging system that tracks all corrections and decision-making processes during image analysis:

**System Components:**
- **AnalysisLogger (src/utils/analysis-logger.ts)**: JSONL-based logging with automatic Supabase upload
- **SmartMatcher Integration**: Tracks OCR, temporal, fuzzy, and participant matching corrections
- **Temporal Clustering**: Logs clustering decisions and burst mode detection

**Log Storage:**
- **Local Files**: `.analysis-logs/` directory in user data folder
- **Remote Access**: Automatic upload to Supabase Storage bucket `analysis-logs`
- **Naming Convention**: `exec_{execution_id}.jsonl` for easy correlation with desktop executions

**Log Contents (JSONL format):**
- `EXECUTION_START`: Total images, category, participant preset info
- `IMAGE_ANALYSIS`: AI response, corrections applied, final results
- `CORRECTION`: Individual correction with human-readable explanations
- `TEMPORAL_CLUSTER`: Clustering decisions and burst mode detection
- `PARTICIPANT_MATCH`: Fuzzy matching results and evidence
- `EXECUTION_COMPLETE`: Final statistics and performance metrics

**Accessing Logs:**
1. **During Development**: Logs upload every 30 seconds to Supabase Storage
2. **Remote Debugging**: Access via Supabase dashboard → Storage → analysis-logs
3. **Log Correlation**: Use execution_id from desktop app to find corresponding log file
4. **Human-Readable Messages**: Each correction includes explanation like "Corretto numero da 61 a 51 perché foto precedente (250ms fa) e successiva (180ms dopo) mostrano entrambe 51"

**Setup Requirements:**
- Supabase Storage bucket: `analysis-logs` (public read access)
- Database table: `analysis_log_metadata` for searchable log discovery
- Row Level Security: Users can only access their own logs
