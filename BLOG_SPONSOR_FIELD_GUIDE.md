# The Ultimate Guide to Using Sponsor Fields in Racetagger: Power and Pitfalls

## Introduction: A Game-Changing Feature That Demands Respect

The **sponsor field** in Racetagger's Participant Preset is arguably the most powerful tool in your automatic recognition arsenal. When used correctly, it can transform impossible matches into perfect identifications. When used carelessly, it can turn a 95% accurate system into a frustrating guessing game.

This guide will teach you everything you need to know to harness the full power of sponsor fields while avoiding the common pitfalls that trip up even experienced users.

## Why Sponsor Fields Are So Powerful

### The Science Behind Sponsor Matching

Racetagger's SmartMatcher system doesn't just look for race numbers. It employs a sophisticated multi-evidence approach:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis** - Processes ALL sponsors detected by AI in the image
2. **Intelligent Prioritization** - Unique sponsors (appearing only once in your preset) get processed first
3. **Massive Scoring Boost** - Unique sponsors receive ~90 points (comparable to race numbers) vs ~40 points for common sponsors
4. **Contradiction Detection** - Penalizes matches when AI sees sponsors the participant doesn't have

### Real-World Impact

**Scenario: Podium photo with no visible race number**

```
AI detects: "Shell", "Puma", "M Motorsport" (on driver's suit)
Your preset has:
  Car #15: "iQOO, M Motorsport, DHL, Shell, Puma" ‚Üê M Motorsport is UNIQUE
  Car #31: "Snap-on, BMW M Motorsport, Shell, Pirelli"
  Car #46: "Alpinestars, BMW Team, Michelin"

System identifies: Car #15 with 90-point confidence
Result: Perfect match on a photo where traditional OCR would fail
```

Without proper sponsor configuration, this photo would require manual tagging. With smart sponsors, it's automatic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Dark Side: How Sponsors Can Go Wrong

### Common Mistake #1: Generic Sponsors

**WRONG:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
15,Driver A,"BMW, Shell, Pirelli"
31,Driver B,"BMW, Shell, Pirelli"
46,Driver C,"BMW, Shell, Pirelli"
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- All three cars share identical sponsors
- No discriminating values
- System cannot distinguish between vehicles
- Random matches based on generic sponsors

**RIGHT:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
15,Driver A,"iQOO, M Motorsport, DHL, Shell, Puma"
31,Driver B,"Snap-on, BMW M Motorsport, Shell, Pirelli"
46,Driver C,"Alpinestars, BMW Team, Michelin"
```

**Why it works:**
- Each vehicle has 1-2 unique sponsors
- "M Motorsport" appears only on #15 ‚Üí massive boost
- "Snap-on" appears only on #31 ‚Üí massive boost
- System can clearly distinguish between vehicles

### Common Mistake #2: Too-Similar Sponsors

**WRONG:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
5,Team Red Bull,"Red Bull, Red Bull Racing, RB Racing"
77,Team Red Bull 2,"Red Bull, Red Bull Racing, RB Racing"
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Nearly identical sponsors between different vehicles
- Fuzzy matching creates ambiguity
- "Red Bull Racing" might match "RB Racing"
- Impossible to distinguish #5 from #77

**RIGHT:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
5,Max VERSTAPPEN,"Oracle, Red Bull, Honda Racing"
77,Sergio PEREZ,"Telcel, Red Bull, Honda Racing"
```

**Why it works:**
- "Oracle" is unique to #5
- "Telcel" is unique to #77
- Common sponsors ("Red Bull", "Honda Racing") don't create confusion

### Common Mistake #3: Missing or Incomplete Sponsors

**WRONG:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Driver A,""
2,Driver B,"Shell"
3,Driver C,"Pirelli, Puma"
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Car #1 has no sponsors ‚Üí impossible to identify without number
- Car #2 has one generic sponsor ‚Üí ambiguous if other cars have "Shell"
- Valuable information lost

**RIGHT:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Driver A,"Martini Racing, Gulf, Heuer"
2,Driver B,"Shell, Ferrari, Santander, Ray-Ban"
3,Driver C,"Pirelli, Puma, Monster Energy, Alpinestars"
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices: Your Sponsor Field Playbook

### 1. Pre-Event Visual Research

**BEFORE the event, gather visual information:**

```
Checklist for each car/rider:
‚ñ° Screenshots from official website
‚ñ° Photos from social media (team/driver accounts)
‚ñ° Official entry list with sponsor details
‚ñ° Onboard/highlight videos from previous races
‚ñ° Test/practice session photos
```

**Useful sources:**
- Official championship website
- Instagram/Facebook (teams and drivers)
- Motorsport.com / Autosport
- YouTube (official videos, onboards)
- Official entry list PDFs

**Pro tip:** Create a photo folder for each event with livery references. This 30-minute investment will save hours of manual corrections.

### 2. Proper Formatting

**Recommended format:**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
15,Driver Name,"Sponsor1, Sponsor2, Sponsor3, Sponsor4"
```

**Formatting rules:**

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Separate sponsors with comma + space: `"Shell, Pirelli, Puma"`
- Use complete brand names: `"M Motorsport"` not `"M"`
- Respect brand capitalization: `"BMW M Team"` not `"bmw m team"`
- Include 4-8 sponsors per vehicle (balanced approach)
- Order from most visible to least visible

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Separate with semicolons: `"Shell; Pirelli; Puma"` ‚ùå
- Make up abbreviations: `"M Mot"` instead of `"M Motorsport"` ‚ùå
- Use all caps: `"SHELL, PIRELLI"` ‚ùå
- Too few sponsors (1-2): low discrimination ‚ùå
- Too many sponsors (>15): noise, matching difficulty ‚ùå

### 3. Identifying Unique Sponsors: The Secret Sauce

**The key to perfect matches:**

```
Identification process:
1. List ALL visible sponsors on each vehicle
2. Highlight sponsors appearing on ONLY ONE vehicle
3. Verify these sponsors are VISIBLE in typical photos
4. Prioritize LARGE and READABLE sponsors
```

**Practical example - WEC GT3:**

```csv
# Car #15 - BMW M TEAM WRT
sponsors: "iQOO, M Motorsport, DHL, Shell, Puma"
           ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
           UNIQUE - high priority for matching

# Car #31 - BMW M TEAM WRT 2
sponsors: "Snap-on, BMW M Motorsport, Shell, Pirelli"
           ^^^^^^^
           UNIQUE - high priority for matching

# Car #46 - TEAM WRT
sponsors: "Valentino Rossi, Alpinestars, BMW, Michelin"
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^
           UNIQUE - high priority for matching
```

**Result:**
- Each car has 1-2 UNIQUE visible sponsors
- System can identify correctly even without number
- Reliable matches on podium/pit/profile photos

### 4. Managing Common Sponsors

**When multiple vehicles share sponsors (e.g., team sponsors):**

```csv
# Scenario: BMW team with 3 cars

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - balance common + unique
number,name,sponsors
15,Driver A,"iQOO, M Motorsport, BMW M Team, Shell"
            ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^  [common]      [common]
31,Driver B,"Snap-on, BMW M Motorsport, BMW M Team, Shell"
            ^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  [common]      [common]
46,Driver C,"Alpinestars, Valentino Rossi, BMW M Team, Michelin"
            ^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  [common]      ^^^^^^^^

ANALYSIS:
- "BMW M Team", "Shell" ‚Üí common (low weight)
- "iQOO", "M Motorsport", "Snap-on", "Alpinestars", "Valentino Rossi", "Michelin" ‚Üí UNIQUE
- Each car identifiable via unique sponsors
```

**Golden rule:** Every car should have at least ONE sponsor that no other car in your preset has.

### 5. Preset Validation

**Before using your preset, verify:**

```
Validation checklist:
‚ñ° Does each car have at least 1 unique sponsor?
‚ñ° Are unique sponsors VISIBLE in typical photos?
‚ñ° Are sponsor names spelled correctly?
‚ñ° Is formatting consistent (comma + space)?
‚ñ° Are there no duplicate sponsors in the same field?
‚ñ° Do sponsors reflect the CURRENT livery for this event?
```

**Mental validation tool:**

For each car, ask yourself:
> "If I could only see sponsors (no number), could I identify this car?"

If the answer is **NO**, add unique sponsors.

### 6. Preset Maintenance

**Sponsors change frequently!**

```
Preset update schedule:
‚ñ° Verify liveries before EVERY event
‚ñ° Check for mid-season sponsor changes
‚ñ° Update sponsors for special races (one-off liveries)
‚ñ° Document variations between qualifying and race
‚ñ° Keep backups of previous presets
```

**Common change scenarios:**
- Different title sponsor for specific race (e.g., Monaco)
- Special livery (anniversaries, tributes)
- Mid-season sponsor change
- Variable number (reserve driver)

## üìä Sponsor Quality Matrix

| Scenario | Configured Sponsors | Match Quality | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Ideal** | 4-8 sponsors, 2+ unique, highly visible | 95-99% | ‚úÖ Excellent - use as is |
| **Good** | 3-6 sponsors, 1 unique, visible | 85-95% | ‚úÖ Works well |
| **Acceptable** | 2-4 sponsors, common but distinctive | 70-85% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Improve with unique sponsors |
| **Problematic** | 1-2 sponsors, all common | 50-70% | ‚ùå Add unique sponsors |
| **Critical** | Missing sponsors or identical across cars | <50% | ‚ùå Requires urgent intervention |

## üéØ Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: WEC GT3 - BMW Cars

**Situation:** 3 BMW cars from same team, nearly identical liveries

**Preset BEFORE (problematic):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
15,Driver A,"BMW"
31,Driver B,"BMW"
46,Driver C,"BMW"
```
**Result:** 40% accuracy - impossible to distinguish without number

**Preset AFTER (optimal):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
15,Dries VANTHOOR,"iQOO, M Motorsport, DHL, Shell, Puma, BMW M Team WRT"
31,Augusto FARFUS,"Snap-on, BMW M Motorsport, Shell, Pirelli, BMW M Team WRT"
46,Valentino ROSSI,"Alpinestars, Valentino Rossi VR46, BMW, Michelin, Monster Energy"
```
**Result:** 98% accuracy - perfect identification even without number

**Key insight:** Adding unique sponsors transformed an unusable preset into an exceptional one.

### Case Study 2: MotoGP - Ducati Team

**Situation:** 8 Ducati bikes, partially overlapping sponsors

**Preset BEFORE (problematic):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Bagnaia,"Ducati, Pramac"
89,Martin,"Ducati, Pramac"
```
**Result:** Systematic confusion between #1 and #89

**Preset AFTER (optimal):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Francesco BAGNAIA,"Ducati Lenovo Team, Lenovo, Pramac, Shell, SKY VR46"
89,Jorge MARTIN,"Prima Pramac Racing, Prima, Pramac, Estrella Galicia, Michelin"
```
**Result:** "Lenovo" unique to #1, "Prima" unique to #89 ‚Üí 95% accuracy

**Key insight:** Even with shared team sponsors ("Pramac"), unique personal/title sponsors enable clear identification.

### Case Study 3: F1 - Red Bull vs Red Bull Junior

**Situation:** Main team and junior team with similar sponsors

**Preset BEFORE (problematic):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Verstappen,"Red Bull"
22,Tsunoda,"Red Bull"
```
**Result:** Random matches

**Preset AFTER (optimal):**
```csv
number,name,sponsors
1,Max VERSTAPPEN,"Oracle Red Bull Racing, Oracle, Honda, Mobil 1"
22,Yuki TSUNODA,"Visa Cash App RB, Visa, Cash App, Honda, Pirelli"
```
**Result:** "Oracle" vs "Visa Cash App" ‚Üí clear distinction

**Key insight:** Full team names and title sponsors provide critical differentiation.

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Always wrong match on photos without number"

**Diagnosis:**
```
1. Check SmartMatcher logs:
   ‚Üí Which sponsors are detected by AI?
   ‚Üí Which sponsors are matched?
   ‚Üí Are there contradictions?

2. Verify unique sponsors:
   ‚Üí Does each car have at least 1 unique sponsor?
   ‚Üí Are unique sponsors VISIBLE in photos?
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Add VISIBLE unique sponsors for each car
2. Remove sponsors that are too small/illegible
3. Verify sponsor spelling (must match AI OCR)
4. Test on sample photos
```

### Issue: "Continuous contradictions in logs"

**Diagnosis:**
```
Log shows:
‚ö†Ô∏è CONTRADICTION: AI detected unique sponsor "Snap-on" NOT belonging to participant #15

Cause: Car #15 matched but "Snap-on" belongs to #31
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Verify sponsors in preset are CORRECT
2. Check that AI is detecting correct sponsors
3. Consider if there are sponsors SHARED between different cars
4. Update preset if liveries have changed
```

### Issue: "AI detects sponsors but doesn't use them"

**Diagnosis:**
```
Log shows:
üîç Analyzing 4 sponsors for participant #15:
  ‚Üí 0 UNIQUE sponsors
  ‚Üí 4 common sponsors: [BMW, Shell, Pirelli, Puma]

Cause: No unique sponsors in preset
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Research specific sponsors for each car
2. Add visible secondary sponsors
3. Use full sponsor names: "M Motorsport" not "BMW"
4. Check official entry list
```

## üí° Advanced Tips for Power Users

### Tip 1: Sponsor Hierarchy

Not all sponsors are created equal. Prioritize in this order:

1. **Title sponsor** (full team name): `"Oracle Red Bull Racing"`
2. **Main sponsors** (large, prominent): `"Oracle"`, `"Red Bull"`
3. **Technical partners** (visible on livery): `"Honda Racing"`, `"Pirelli"`
4. **Secondary sponsors** (smaller but readable): `"Mobil 1"`, `"Tag Heuer"`

### Tip 2: The "3-Second Rule"

If you can't read a sponsor clearly in a photo viewed for 3 seconds, don't include it. The AI won't reliably detect it either.

### Tip 3: Livery Variations

For events with special liveries (e.g., Monaco historics, charity events):

```csv
# Create event-specific preset
number,name,sponsors
# Monaco special livery
15,Driver A,"Martini, Gulf, Tag Heuer"  # Different from regular season
```

Keep multiple presets for different events if liveries vary significantly.

### Tip 4: Testing Strategy

Before processing 1000+ photos:

1. **Select 10 representative test photos** (various angles, conditions)
2. **Process with your preset**
3. **Check SmartMatcher logs** for each
4. **Identify patterns** in mismatches
5. **Refine sponsors** based on findings
6. **Re-test until 90%+ accuracy**

This 15-minute investment prevents hours of manual corrections.
